# MBMA

A Mapping Based Microbiome Analysis tool for species and resistance genes quantification

## About
  A main challenge in the field of metagenomics is to quickly and precisely determine the composition and the relative abundance of constituents of a microbial community. State-of-the-art metagenomic methods rely on mapping-, kmer- or assembly- based  approaches for identification and quantification. However, currently available methods are either time-consuming or fail to provide an accurate quantification at gene and strain levels. 

  To overcome these limitations, we developed Mapping Based Microbiome Analysis (MBMA), a mapping-based approach for identification and quantification of species, strains and resistance genes, with two main innovations: the use of a more efficient and discriminatory database for rapid quantification, and an optimized counting method for an accurate abundance prediction
